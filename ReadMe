This repository is organized according to the primary figures, with each
directory containing the .Rmd file used to generate the figures. The data for
all figures is located in the data directory. The Supplementary Figures
directory contains the .Rmd files used to generate Supplementary Figures S1, S2,
and S4. The code to generate Supplementary Figures S3, S5, and S6 is located in
the .Rmd files for primary Figures 1, 5, and 2, respectively.

For a description of the .Rmd files, including a list of the primary and
supplementary figures generated with each file, please see `File Descriptions`.
`File Descriptions` also includes which Supplementary Tables are relevant to
